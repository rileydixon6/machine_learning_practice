# machine_learning_practice
Several different types of machine learning models I have worked with including, decision tree models, image classification, random forest models, gradient boost, and neural networks. While none of these models are as good as I would like them to be, the purpose of them is for me to begin to practice and learn about different elements in each model and how to create a more effective model.
